# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
version control is like a time machine.  It allows you to roll back to previous versions of software because a new version may not be working as anticipated.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
a branch is when someone is working on a new feature and allows them to work in a controlled enviornment. This is useful because when someone goes to merge their code into the master they can see if there are any conflicts and resolve them.  It keeps the master in good working order.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is like saying "i'm done with this code and it's ready" and a good message is specific and useful.

* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflict is when code is written into the same line in the same file and git is asking what to do.
